# Create-a-strong-password-and-Evaluate-its-strength



### üîß Tool Used

I used PasswordMeter to test the strength of different passwords. (https://passwordmeter.com/)

## Objective

To understand what makes a password strong, test multiple passwords against online strength checkers, and analyze how complexity affects security.

 Tested Passwords & Result
| **Password**              | **Strength**   | **Reason** |
|----------------------------|----------------|-------------|
| `123456`                  | Weak           | Very short, only numbers, common password. |
| `password`                | Weak           | Only lowercase letters, commonly used word. |
| `hello123`                | Weak           | Short, predictable pattern, no special symbols. |
| `Summer2025`              | Medium         | Includes uppercase + numbers, but predictable word. |
| `Hello@123`               | Medium         | Mix of letters, numbers, symbol, but short. |
| `H3llo@2025`              | Strong         | Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbol. |
| `H@ck3r_Life2025`         | Strong         | Longer, uses letters, numbers, symbols. |
| `M@tr1x$P@ssW0rd#99`      | Very Strong    | 18+ chars, multiple character types, hard to guess. |
| `T1m3$Tr@v3ll3r!2025#X`   | Very Strong    | Long (20+ chars), complex, unpredictable. |



üîç Analysis

- Weak passwords are easily broken by brute force and dictionary attacks.

- Adding symbols, numbers, and uppercase letters improves password strength.

- Length plays a crucial role: longer passwords exponentially increase resistance to attacks.

- Passphrases (long combinations of words with symbols) are both secure and easier to remember.

- ## Attackers use several techniques to crack weak passwords. Below are the most common ones:

### 1. Brute Force Attack

- The attacker tries every possible combination of characters until the correct password is found.

- Example: Cracking abc123 by testing all combinations (aaa, aab, aac ‚Ä¶).

- Time-consuming, but effective against short passwords.

### 2. Dictionary Attack

- Uses a precompiled list of common words and passwords.

- Example: If your password is password123, it will be found instantly since ‚Äúpassword‚Äù is in almost every dictionary list.


‚úÖ Best Practices for Strong Passwords

- Use at least 12‚Äì16 characters.

- Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.

- Avoid personal information (name, birthday, phone number).

- Use passphrases (e.g., Sun$et@Mountains2025!).

- Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for maximum protection.



üìå Conclusion

### Password strength directly impacts security.

- Weak passwords (123456, hello123) are highly vulnerable.

- Medium-strength passwords (Summer2025, Hello@123) are better but still predictable.

- Strong passwords (H3llo@2025, H@ck3r_Life2025) resist attacks more effectively.

- Very strong passwords (M@tr1x$P@ssW0rd#99, T1m3$Tr@v3ll3r!2025#X) are highly secure against brute force and dictionary attacks.

üëâ Strong passwords + MFA = Best Security Practice.
